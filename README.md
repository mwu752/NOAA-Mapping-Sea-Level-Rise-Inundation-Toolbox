# NOAA-Mapping-Sea-Level-Rise-Inundation-Toolbox
This tool implements the mapping process developed by the NOAA Office for Coastal Management to visualize sea level rise inundation in the Sea Level Rise Viewer. The method follows a modified bathtub approach that incorporates local and regional tidal variability, as well as hydrological connectivity.
